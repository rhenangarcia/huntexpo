# 🚀 Welcome to huntexpo

[Expo version](https://expo.io/) of the application developed in the **[Starter / React Native Course](https://rocketseat.com.br/starter)** by **[Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)**.

It consists of a mobile application to expose the API built in the [huntapi project](https://github.com/rhenangarcia/huntapi), displaying the digital products stored in the Mongo database.
